<center><h2>THE BROKEN GIRL</h2></center>

<p>As a little girl, I was always told wonderful stories with happy endings and that made me believe in them but I realised how wrong I was. My name is Mia and this is a story of a broken girl who could never get the happy ending she was always told about.</p><br>

<p>My parents were wonderful and I was an only child. My mom would always read me bed time stories and my dad, he treated me as his little princess. However, my life became a nightmare after that accident that occurred when I was ten years old. I lost both my parents in a car accident. I believed that the accident was my fault as I was being whiny which made my dad lose focus on the road causing a big crash. My mom and dad died right in front of my eyes. However, the ambulance came just in time and I was saved. I really wished I had died in that accident but you can't always get what you wish for.
My parents were my life and I wasn't really close with my other relatives as I was socially awkward as a child. The death of my parents changed me so much.</p><br>

<p>A week after their death, my father's sister, Clara took me in. She was a sweet lady. Her, her husband and her son, Jason, who was 11, were really nice to me. However, I still hadn't gotten over the fact that my parents were dead. I thought it was all a nightmare and I would wake up from it.
Once they took me in they treated me with kindness.</p> <br>

<p>As a little child, I always had nightmares of my parents' death. My nights always ended up with me waking up screaming. There was nothing I could do to stop the nightmares. I felt very guilty for their death.</p>

<p>A month after I began leaving with them, they decided to enrol me into Jason's school. It was a new environment for me and I was very nervous on my first day but I pushed through so as not to disappoint my aunt. I felt like a burden to them so I made sure to pretend that I was okay even though I was not.</p> <br>

<p>Everything was going well, at least that was all everyone believed. In school, I could not make any friends because I was socially awkward and I avoided crowds or people in general. Jason tried to help me make friends but I didn't want to make friends.</p><br>

<p>Fast forward six years later, I was now in my final year of high school. I and Jason were in the same class as I had skipped a year due to my intelligence. My life was hell and I still had nightmares every night. The guilt I felt had gotten worse so I began to cut myself in order to feel less guilty. I also thought that I deserved to feel the pain. No one around me noticed because I was so used to putting up a facade that everyone believed I was truly happy.</p><br>

<p>In my final year, Jason introduced me to his friends so we all began to hang out. I had become friends with Xavier, Xander and Jenny. Xavier and Xander were my cousin, Jason's best friends while Jenny was his girlfriend. I like Jenny and thought she was nice. Xavier was a big flirt and Xander was a bit grumpy but I got along well with them. I believed that they hung out with me because of Jason. 
I did not actually believe that I deserved to have friends but so that Jason wouldn't worry, I pretended to be fine with being around him and his friends. I always felt out of place when ever I was with them but I had become so good at faking it.</p><br>

<p>I felt like I wasn't loved and that I didn't deserve to be loved. Anytime I tried to be comfortable, I would always be reminded about my parents death. I was broken beyond measure and no one could fix me as no one was aware.</p><br>

<p>I was suffering with depression and I was even cutting myself. I had scars on my laps. I made sure to cut myself in places where no one would see as I didn't want anyone to notice. There were voices in my head telling me that no one cares about me and I believed those voices and continued to cut myself.
I couldn't even sleep properly because the nightmares were no longer of the accident but rather, in the nightmare, all the people around me called me names and blamed me for my parents's death including my parents. I felt like the whole world was against me. I really wanted to end my life.</p><br>

<p>After our final exams, a day before graduation, I decided to commit suicide. I overdosed on some pills but I woke up in a hospital. I was confused as to why I wasn't dead, it turns out that Jason had saved me.
Once I regained consciousness, Jason, his friends and Aunt Clara, were right by my side. They looked very sad and I had an expressionless look on my face. They found out that I had been cutting myself as they saw the scars. The doctor also confirmed that I was severely depressed. The doctor suggested that I see a therapist. I was listening to the doctor with a blank expression on my face.
My aunt looked very sad and disappointed. Even Jason was saddened by this. Aunt Clara asked me since when this has been going on. I didn't want to lie to her so I told her that it had been going on since my parents death.
Aunt Clara blamed herself for not noticing it sooner but I knew that it wasn't her fault, rather I was just very good at faking being happy.</p><br>

<p>After a week I was released from the hospital, I had to miss graduation as well as Jason. Everyone treated me like I was fragile but that just made my depression very worse and the voices in my head were becoming harder to ignore. Those voice kept telling me to end it all that everyone would be happy that way.
Aunt Clara came to talk to me and asked me how I was feeling, I told her I was fine but I knew I wasn't. I just didn't want anyone to worry.
My mind was my greatest enemy and it made me believe that no one really cared about me so I though I would be doing everyone a favour if I was gone. I was broken beyond repair and nothing anyone could do or say could fix me.
I managed to ignore the voices in my head for two weeks. The nightmares were still there and they were worse than ever. Everyone acted so strangely around me. Things were no longer as they used to be.
I was so angry with myself as I  believed that I was at fault. I thought that if I had kept up that facade of being happy then no one would have gotten hurt.</p><br>

<p>Finally, after two weeks, I gave in to the voices and decided to end my life. I believed that it would be best for everyone if I was dead.
    I had woken up from my nightmares again that night. I was tired of pretending to be happy and fighting the voices so I decided to give in.
    I went into the kitchen silently and held the knife. The voices kept telling me to cut myself with it and I listened. I cut myself with the knife and blood continued to pour.
    I fell down with a thud which woke Aunt Clara and Jason. They came downstairs and found me in a pool of blood. I was smiling at them and before I took my last breath, I said "I can't fight them anymore, I am sorry."</p><br>

    <p>Mia was a broken girl who had been affected so much by the death of her parents. She had always believed in happy endings but maybe not all stories had happy endings. Mia was suffering and withering away from the inside and no one seemed to notice. She believed in her own weird way that she would finally get her happy ending by dying. She must be happy wherever she is. As a little girl, I was always told wonderful stories with happy endings and that made me believe in them but I realised how wrong I was.
